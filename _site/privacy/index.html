# Privacy Policy

<p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 1, 2024</p>

Intrusive Memory Productions ("we," "us," or "our") operates Produciesta (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Account Information**: If you create an account, we may collect your email address for support communications.
- **Support Requests**: When you contact us for support, we collect the information you provide in your request.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Analytics Data**: We use TelemetryDeck for anonymous analytics. This includes:
  - Anonymous session identifiers (not linked to your identity)
  - App version and operating system
  - General device type (iPhone, iPad, Mac)
  - Feature usage patterns (anonymized)
  - Crash reports (anonymized)

**Important**: TelemetryDeck does not collect personally identifiable information. Analytics data cannot be used to identify you.

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- **Your Screenplays**: Your creative content stays on your device. We never upload, store, or access your screenplays.
- **Audio Generations**: Generated audio files are created locally or via direct API calls to voice services. We do not store or access this content.
- **API Keys**: If you use the BYOK feature, your ElevenLabs API key is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to our servers.

## How We Use Your Information

We use collected information to:

- Improve the App's features and performance
- Understand how users interact with the App
- Identify and fix bugs and crashes
- Respond to support requests
- Comply with legal obligations

## Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with:

- **Service Providers**: We use TelemetryDeck for analytics. They process data according to their privacy policy.
- **Voice Services**: When generating audio, your dialogue text is sent directly to the voice service (built-in or ElevenLabs). This is necessary for the App to function.
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights.

## Third-Party Services

### TelemetryDeck (Analytics)

We use TelemetryDeck for privacy-respecting analytics. TelemetryDeck:
- Does not use cookies
- Does not collect IP addresses
- Does not track users across apps
- Is GDPR compliant

Learn more: [telemetrydeck.com/privacy](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy)

### ElevenLabs (Voice Generation - Pro BYOK)

If you connect your own ElevenLabs API key:
- Text is sent directly to ElevenLabs for voice generation
- This connection is between your device and ElevenLabs
- ElevenLabs' privacy policy applies to this data

Learn more: [elevenlabs.io/privacy](https://elevenlabs.io/privacy)

## Data Retention

- **Analytics Data**: Aggregated analytics are retained for up to 24 months.
- **Support Communications**: Retained as long as needed to resolve your request, then deleted.
- **Local Data**: Your screenplays and generated audio are stored only on your device. Deleting the App removes this data.
