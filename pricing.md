        <button class="faq-question">What is "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK)?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>BYOK allows Pro subscribers to connect their own ElevenLabs API key to Produciesta. This gives you access to your personal ElevenLabs voice library, including any custom voices you've created. Your API usage is billed directly by ElevenLabs at their standard rates, giving you full control over your voice generation costs and capabilities.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Do I need an ElevenLabs account to use Produciesta?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>No! Produciesta includes a built-in voice library that works out of the box. The BYOK feature is optional and only available to Pro subscribers who want to use their own ElevenLabs voices.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What counts as a "generation"?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A generation is counted each time you generate audio for a scene. If you regenerate the same scene with different settings or voices, that counts as an additional generation. Pro subscribers have unlimited generations.</p>
