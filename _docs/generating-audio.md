## Assigning Voices

### Browse the Voice Library

2. Click on a character name
3. The voice library panel will open

The voice library includes:
- **Standard voices** (Free tier): A selection of quality AI voices
- **Premium voices** (Pro tier): Extended library with more variety
- **Your voices** (Pro + BYOK): Custom ElevenLabs voices

### Preview Voices

Before assigning a voice:
1. Click the **Play** button next to any voice
2. Listen to a sample of how that voice sounds
3. Try different voices until you find the right fit

### Assign a Voice

1. Select the voice you want
2. Click **Assign** to apply it to the character
3. The voice will be used for all that character's dialogue

### Voice Settings

Fine-tune each character's voice:

- **Speed**: Adjust speaking pace (0.5x to 2x)
- **Pitch**: Modify voice pitch
- **Emotion**: Select emotional tone (where supported)

## Generating Audio

### Generate a Single Scene

1. Go to the **Scenes** tab
2. Click on the scene you want to generate
3. Click the **Generate** button
4. Wait for processing to complete
5. Listen to the result

### Generate Multiple Scenes

1. Select multiple scenes using checkboxes
2. Click **Generate Selected**
3. Scenes will be processed in order
4. Progress is shown in the status bar

### Batch Generation

For full screenplay generation:
1. Click **Generate All**
2. All scenes will be queued for processing
3. Generation happens in the background
4. You can continue working while it processes

## Reviewing Results

After generation:

1. **Play** the scene to listen
2. **Compare** with the original dialogue
3. **Regenerate** if needed with different settings

### Making Adjustments

If a scene doesn't sound right:

1. Try adjusting voice speed or pitch
2. Switch to a different voice
3. Regenerate the scene

Each regeneration counts toward your monthly limit (Free tier) or is unlimited (Pro tier).

## Tips for Best Results

### Voice Selection
- Match voice characteristics to character descriptions
- Consider age, gender, and personality
- Preview multiple options before deciding

### Pacing
- Adjust speed for emotional scenes
- Action scenes may benefit from faster pacing
- Dramatic moments often work better slower

### Generation Quality
- Shorter scenes generate more consistently
- Very long dialogue may need to be split
- Complex character names may affect pronunciation

## Usage Limits

**Free tier**: 30 generations per month
**Pro tier**: Unlimited generations

A generation is counted each time you generate audio for a scene, including regenerations.
