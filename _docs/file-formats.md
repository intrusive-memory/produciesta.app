## Screenplay Formatting Requirements

For best import results, ensure your screenplays follow these conventions:

### Scene Headings
```
INT. LOCATION - TIME
EXT. LOCATION - TIME
```

### Character Names
```
CHARACTER NAME
(in uppercase, before dialogue)
```

### Dialogue
```
CHARACTER NAME
The dialogue text goes here, following
the character name.
```

### Parentheticals
```
CHARACTER NAME
(whispering)
The dialogue with direction.
```

### Action Lines
```
Regular prose describing action, not in uppercase.
```

## Limitations

### PDF Import
- Scanned documents may have OCR errors
- Non-standard formatting may cause parsing issues
- Very complex layouts may not parse correctly

### Plain Text Import
- Requires consistent formatting
- May need manual corrections after import
- No metadata is preserved

## Recommended Workflow

For the best experience:

1. **Write in Fountain or Final Draft** for native support
2. **Export to Fountain** from other screenwriting apps if possible
3. **Use PDF as last resort** for scripts you can't get in other formats
4. **Review after import** to catch any parsing issues
